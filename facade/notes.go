package facade

/*
    Overview:
        Balancing complexity and presentation/usability
        Many systems working to provide flexibility but...
        API consumers want it to 'just work'

    Facade: Provides a simple, east to understand user interface over a large and sophisticated body of code.

    Summary:
        Build a Facade to provide a simplified API over a set of components
        May wish to (optionally) expose internals through the facade
        May allow users to 'escalate' to use more complex APIs if the need to
