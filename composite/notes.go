package composite

/*
    Overview:
        Objects use other objects' fields/methods through embedding
        Composition lets us make compound objects
            - e.g., a mathematical expression composed of simple expressions; or
            - a shape group made of several different shapes
        Composite design pattern is used to treat both single (scalar) and composite objects uniformly
            - i.e.: Foo and []Foo have common APIs
    Composite: A mechanism for treating individual (scalar) objects and compositions of objects in a uniform manner

    Summary:
        Objects can use other objects via composition
        Some composed and singular objects need similar/identical behaviors
        Composite design patter lets us treat both types of objects uniformly
        Iteration supported with the Iterator design pattern
