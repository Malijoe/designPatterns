package strategy
/*
    Overview:
        Many algorithms can be decomposed into higher- and lower- level parts
        The high-level algorithm can be made to be reusable for a variety of scenarios

    Strategy:  Separates an algorithm into its 'skeleton' and concrete implementation steps, which can be varied at run-time.

    Summary:
        Define an algorithm at a high level
        Define the interface you expect each strategy to follow
        Support the injection of the strategy into the high-level algorithm
